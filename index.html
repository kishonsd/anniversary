                    When I first laid eyes on you I had to fight off feelings of nervousness because I was also facing a strong feeling of wanting to know more about you.
                    "Who is this beautiful girl?" is what I kept asking myself. I wanted to get your attention but I knew I had to first clean up my own messes. No way would a girl this beautiful be interested
                    in someone who has so much to figure out about himself. But I did, and I am always amazed and grateful that you chose me.

                    laughing with you about anything and everything is enough to get a million man army through a war. My war is fought interally, and so your ability to pull me out of it
                    so easily with just some much as a smile in my direction is so much more than I ever thought I would have.</p>

                    of ugliness. I mean that the beautiful you were yeterday and the beautiful you are today are always two seperate forms, and in the best ways. Yesterday I admired your beauty because the slight change in your laugh
                    combined with the way you shyly pulled away from me to hide your blush, is something I log in my "Most Beautiful Things" list, and today the way you looked back at me to blow me a kiss
                    before dissappearing around a corner, was added to that same list. The list continues to change. I swap new things in and out. It will always change and evolve, because you will always be
